HUIDSN (Hands of User in Digital System Networks)
HUIDSN is a project that enables users to operate a computer or laptop system through hand gestures, eliminating the need for a keyboard. The unique menu bar allows for cursor navigation, adjustments to brightness, volume, and mute functions. Additionally, we can deliver a comprehensive presentation to a wide audience without the need for human system operation. Actions such as horizontal scrolling, annotation, and essential mouse motions can also be executed. Moreover, one can also convert speech to writing. To enhance functionality, the system analyzes any speech input and provides related responses in speech format.

To prevent ambiguity with hand gestures for different functions, we have categorized comparable gestures that can be utilized independently by selecting the corresponding option from the menu bar located on the right side of the taskbar.
